Joint Diagonalisation (JD) is a mathematical technique used to estimate an average eigenspace across a set of matrices. While widely applied in system dynamics, its use in network analysis is relatively new. Dr Yoneki explores the application of JD to matrices representing spanning trees of dynamic networks, where no single static graph can fully describe interactions.

By using JD, an average eigenspace can be constructed to represent an “average spanning tree” — effectively capturing the most common propagation paths in a network. Analysing deviations from this average reveals that real-world contact networks exhibit multi-modal distributions, corresponding to distinct behavioural modes over time.

This decomposition allows researchers to model networks as a mixture of dynamic and static graphs, providing deeper insights into temporal evolution and structural variability in real-world contact systems.
