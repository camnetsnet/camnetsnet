Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella encode over a hundred small RNAs that do not produce proteins but instead regulate gene expression. These ‘riboregulators’ can amplify or attenuate genetic expression depending on context, act redundantly on common targets, or influence multiple targets in complex regulatory networks. Through these interactions, riboregulators enable bacteria to respond dynamically to environmental changes and maintain metabolic homeostasis. Their rapid and specific activity likely stems from base-pair recognition with target RNAs, though the precise rules governing speed and fidelity remain unclear. Riboregulators also compete for a limiting factor that facilitates their actions, resulting in dynamic network interplay. Dr Luisi will discuss mechanisms by which riboregulators achieve accurate and rapid transcript silencing, illuminating their broader roles in bacterial gene regulation.
