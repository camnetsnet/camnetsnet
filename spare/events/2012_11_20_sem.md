Technology mediates a large fraction of social interactions, yet large datasets of these interactions—drawn from channels like SMS, mobile phone calls, and online networks—often lack information about the attributes or the nature of relationships between individuals.  

This talk presents research that combines an 18-month mobile phone dataset with supporting self-reported attribute data to unify behavioural data studies with traditional social network analyses based on surveys. The study examines how participants’ valuation of tie strength corresponds with communication behaviour via voice calls and SMS. Results reveal that variations in perceived social tie strength translate into measurable differences in communication patterns across the two channels, providing insights into the interplay between tie attributes and observable social behaviour.
