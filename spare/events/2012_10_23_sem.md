Modeling interactions between sites in space is relevant across fields such as geography, economics, transport, communications, town planning, and archaeology. Prof Evans discusses common features and choices in models of spatial networks, including the recent Radiation model developed by Simini, Barabási, and colleagues. He also addresses how different models of spatial networks can be compared and evaluated, providing insights for prediction and data completion.
