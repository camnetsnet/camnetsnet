Many networks have cohesive groups of nodes called "communities". The study of community structure borrows ideas from many scientific areas, and there are now numerous methods available to find communities algorithmically. My collaborators and I have been very active in this area, and I will discuss some of our work on both methodological development and applications. Examples will include subjects like social networks, brain networks, granular materials, and more.
