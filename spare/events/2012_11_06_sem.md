Recent advances in technology have made it possible to measure social networks with unprecedented precision, using smartphones as sensors. Dr Lehmann's group has been developing a large-scale dataset to capture the complete social network—including face-to-face interactions, telecommunication, and online social networks—of an entire freshman class (~1200 individuals) in 2013.  

This talk covers prior research, the methodology behind establishing an experiment of this scale, and early results from a beta-test involving ~200 participants. The project represents a significant step forward in quantitatively understanding social systems through high-resolution measurement.
