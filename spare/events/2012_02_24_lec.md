In February, the regular CNN seminar will be replaced by a special lecture by Professor Péter Csermely, visiting from the Department of Medical Chemistry, Semmelweis University, Budapest.

Professor Csermely will speak on “Novel Network Centrality and Community Measures – and Their Changes in Crisis and Adaptation.”

His multidisciplinary research group explores the universal properties of networks as conceptual “highways” that facilitate the transfer of ideas across scientific fields. This cross-disciplinary approach enables creative breakthroughs and helps apply biological insights on crisis survival—honed over billions of years—to other complex systems.

As an example of network dynamics, the group analysed the protein–protein interaction network of yeast cells using their Moduland program, which detects pervasively overlapping communities (PLoS ONE 7, e12528). Under heat shock, yeast protein communities became more compact and inter-community bridges decreased (PLoS Comput. Biol. 7, e1002187). This reorganization enhanced adaptation by:
A) focusing resources on vital functions,
B) localizing damage,
C) reducing noise propagation,
D) enabling diverse adaptive strategies within modules, and
E) mediating inter-community conflicts during rapid internal change.

Inter-community or “creative” nodes play particularly influential roles in these adaptive processes. Beyond modular analysis, Professor Csermely’s team has developed several tools to quantify node influence:
	•	Turbine (www.linkgroup.hu/Turbine.php), which identifies nodes with high perturbation-propagation efficiency, and
	•	NetworGame (www.linkgroup.hu/NetworGame.php), which models “game centrality” — the ability of nodes or edges to promote or disrupt cooperation in repeated social dilemma games.

These approaches reveal how spatial games and cooperation dynamics can be understood even in non-conscious systems such as proteins. Together, these novel centrality and community measures provide new insights into how complex systems adapt efficiently to crisis and change.
