Node and edge centrality are pivotal concepts in the analysis of complex networks. Centrality measures are used to identify influential individuals in social groups, rank web pages, and assess scientific impact. Traditionally, centrality depends on the entire network structure, and is computed only after the network is defined.

Dr Nicosia presents a solution to the “inverse centrality problem”—the task of controlling node centrality values by modifying the network structure. Focusing on spectral centrality measures, he introduces the concept of controlling sets—subsets of nodes that can assign any desired set of centrality values across the network by cooperatively adjusting their outgoing link weights.

Empirical analysis of real-world networks reveals that many have surprisingly small controlling sets, often comprising less than 5–10% of nodes. This finding implies that spectral centrality rankings can be easily influenced or distorted by small, coordinated groups, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting centrality-based metrics.
