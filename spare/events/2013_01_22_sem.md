The characteristics of networks—ranging from biological and physical to social systems—enable computational analyses that provide insights unattainable from examining individual components. Despite this potential, network theory has yet to be widely applied in public health, particularly in interventions addressing parasitic diseases and preventative health behaviors.  

This talk explores how social networks and the resulting social capital can inform disease control strategies. Preliminary results from former “blood-diamond” regions of Sierra Leone and Liberia will be presented, along with discussion of challenges in conducting large-scale, tractable social network surveys in rural, resource-limited settings.
