Recent studies suggest that every biological state can be characterized by a gene expression signature—a defined set of genes and their specific pattern of expression. This principle applies to disease phenotypes, pathway activity, or cellular responses to drugs. While individual genes may poorly capture a state, sets of genes considered together can robustly describe it.

Dr Iorio presents MANTRA (Mode of Action by NeTwoRk Analysis), a computational tool for analyzing the mode of action (MoA) of novel drugs and identifying candidates for drug repurposing. MANTRA integrates network-theory concepts and non-parametric statistics to leverage gene expression patterns for both discovery and repositioning of therapeutics.
