In the study of dynamical processes on networks, there has been intense focus on network structure—i.e., the arrangement of edges and their associated weights—but the effects of the temporal patterns of edges remains poorly understood. In this talk, I will focus on analytically-tractable models in order to identify mechanisms by which temporality affects transient and stationary properties of dynamical processes. In particular, I will study the effect of the waiting-time distribution between events, and of correlations between successive events.
