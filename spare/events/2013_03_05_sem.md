Ensembles of tailored random graphs with controlled topological properties are a natural language for describing real-world networks. They allow precise definitions of structural features, classification of networks, measures of complexity and (dis)similarity, provide ‘null models’ for hypothesis testing, and serve as efficient proxies for real networks in process modelling.  

This seminar explains the connection between networks and tailored random graphs, demonstrates how tools from statistical mechanics and information theory can exploit this connection, and discusses exact algorithms for generating such graphs numerically. Ongoing research and open problems, including analysis of ensembles with many short loops, are also presented.
