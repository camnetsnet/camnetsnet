Dr Panzarasa investigates the role of homophily and focus constraints in shaping scientific collaboration. He distinguishes between status-based and research-based homophily, and between institutional and geographic constraints. Using a community-detection algorithm applied to a co-authorship network in Business and Management (1996–2000), he finds partial support for research-based homophily, strong support for status-based selection, and clear evidence that collaborations are constrained by institutional and geographic factors. The talk highlights both formal and informal channels of scientific exchange and discusses their implications for tie formation in collaborative research.
