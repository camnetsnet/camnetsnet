How can we begin to understand the brain, society, or even quantum entanglement? Many of the most important scientific questions can be seen as manifestations of complex systems. These challenging behaviors that emerge from interactions of many simple components are often studied through complex networks, providing a mathematical framework for explicitly modeling interactions. 

Founded in 2011, our initiative brings together researchers interested in complexity and networks across the University of Cambridge — and now beyond.
