Advances in experimental techniques and literature mining now allow researchers to construct detailed networks of protein–protein interactions. While these networks reveal the architecture of complex biochemical pathways, they are often not cell-type specific and lack the input–output relationships needed to analyse receptor-mediated signalling and drug responses. Dr Saez-Rodriguez presents a hybrid approach that compresses protein networks into logical models—ranging from discrete Boolean circuits to quantitative fuzzy-logic and dynamic differential equation frameworks. Implemented in the CellNOpt toolbox (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/saezrodriguez/software.html), this method integrates experimental data from cells exposed to combinations of ligands and drugs to infer the underlying signalling mechanisms. He illustrates the approach through a study comparing immediate early signalling networks in primary human hepatocytes and four hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines (Cancer Research, 71(16):5400–11, 2011).
