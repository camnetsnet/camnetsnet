The complete set of connections in the brain is called our connectome. Over the last 20 years we have found out more about how this network is organised and how it develops. I will outline some characteristic network features and how they could originate during brain network development. In particular, I will highlight the impact of the spatial organisation and embedding of brain networks and the role of delays on brain dynamics and cognition. Moreover, I will outline how interventions based on connectome information and computational models might be able to improve cognitive function for brain and mental health conditions. For this, I will also discuss how network metrics change after stimulation as well as our ongoing work on developing closed-loop neuromodulation for brain and mental health (depression, schizophrenia, Tourette’s). Finally, I will give some information on the launch of our N3 Centre for Neurotechnology, Neuromodulation, and Neurotherapeutics at the University of Nottingham.
