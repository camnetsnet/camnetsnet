Graph theory has transformed molecular biology over the past decade, providing a framework for analysing gene and protein interactions. Dr Teichmann’s group applies graph-theoretical approaches to:
	•	Examine the topology and evolution of genome-scale networks of physical protein interactions and transcriptional regulatory interactions, revealing the role of gene duplication in network shaping.
	•	Study dynamical processes in protein–protein and regulatory networks.
	•	Analyse interactions within small protein complexes of known 3D structure, uncovering principles of protein assembly and evolution.

Her work demonstrates the power of network-based methods to elucidate structural, functional, and evolutionary properties of biomolecular systems.
