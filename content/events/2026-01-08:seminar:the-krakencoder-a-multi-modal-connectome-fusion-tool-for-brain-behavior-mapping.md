In this talk, Dr. Kuceyeski will introduce the Krakencoder – her lab’s new tool for multi-modal integration of brain network measurements that allows mapping between connectome processing pipelines as well as between structural and functional connectomes. This AI tool allows state of the art preservation of inter-individual differences in brain networks through a shared latent space. In an extension from the original publication earlier this year, she will demonstrate the flexibility of the tool for jointly minimizing site differences (harmonization) as well as maximizing brain-behavior mapping accuracy for various metrics. She also demonstrate how the tool can be used to create interpretable feature importances when mapping to behavior or demographics. This tool represents the power of AI in better understanding the mapping between brain structure and function and behavior.
