Brain functional networks derived from fMRI data are increasingly used to understand information flow in healthy and anomalous human brains, both during tasks and at rest. While a variety of network measures describe the topology of these networks, the underlying forces shaping them into characteristic patterns remain unknown. Dr Vertes examines generative models for the probability of functional connections (edges) between cortical areas (nodes) based on their Euclidean distances in anatomical space.
