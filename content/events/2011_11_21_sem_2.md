Dr Quercia explores how personality traits relate to social media behaviour. In Facebook, he analysed the link between sociometric popularity (number of contacts) and personality traits, testing whether popular users maintain many offline friendships or many superficial connections. Extraversion emerged as the strongest predictor of both offline and Facebook popularity, but there was no evidence supporting the idea that highly connected users maintain more superficial relationships.

On Twitter, analysis of 335 users revealed that both popular and influential users are extroverted and emotionally stable, with popular users scoring high in Openness and influentials in Conscientiousness. Using only three publicly available metrics—following, followers, and listed counts—it is possible to predict a user’s five personality traits with a root-mean-squared error below 0.88 on a [1,5] scale. Linguistic analysis of tweets further shows that popularity and influence also depend on personality and emotions, not just network structure.
