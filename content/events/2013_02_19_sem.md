One of the fundamental interests in systems biomedicine is to understand the functionality of molecules involved with a particular disease. This talk focuses on developing predictive models of biochemical networks to infer: (a) causal molecular interactions and regulations, (b) dynamical behaviours, and (c) the mapping from networks to phenotypic or disease behaviour. Such models enable simulation of hypotheses for experimental testing, accelerating understanding of disease mechanisms.  

The talk emphasizes methods to infer dynamical causal interactions between measured species. It highlights the importance of experimental design: for a network with p measured species, p experiments are required, each independently controlling one species. The resulting network representation is predictive, with steady-state data yielding static network information and time series generating dynamic representations suitable for simulation.  

Incorrect experimental design renders network reconstruction impossible, as any network structure could equally explain the data. Following the outlined methodology ensures meaningful and reliable inference of network structures.
