Network data capturing pairwise relationships between objects arise in diverse domains—from protein interaction networks in biology to social connections among individuals. Analysing and modelling such complex networks has become a central challenge across many scientific fields. Professor Ghahramani reviews probabilistic approaches to modelling networks, including the stochastic blockmodel and infinite relational models. These models assume that each object possesses latent features, with observed links depending on these hidden attributes. Probabilistic inference enables discovery of an unbounded number of latent features—revealing community structures, predicting missing links, and uncovering key statistical properties of networks. To overcome limitations of existing models, he introduces the more flexible Infinite Latent Attribute (ILA) model, demonstrating its effectiveness on link prediction tasks in both biological and social network datasets.
