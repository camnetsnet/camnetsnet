Considering spatial variables in the analysis of social and economic activity is not new, with early studies linking social ties to spatial location, such as the Bank Wiring Room Study and investigations of friendship prevalence relative to home distances.  

Despite growing interest in integrating spatial and social network analyses, spatial approaches remain underrepresented in network science. This talk examines space within complex buildings as a network using the method of *Space Syntax*. Concepts and methods from Space Syntax research will be introduced, and three building types—museums, hospitals, and offices—will be analyzed to explore how spatial networks shape social life and behavioral patterns. Recent research will also be presented on how spatial network analysis can illuminate interaction and communication networks among building users.
