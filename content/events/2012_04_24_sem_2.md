Cell proliferation in mammalian systems is tightly controlled, and loss of this regulation often leads to tumour formation. Multiple mechanisms underlie anti-proliferative and cell survival effects, which can be explored through integrative genomics combined with pathway and network modelling. Dr Samarajiwa examines processes such as cellular senescence and apoptosis—both key in preventing tumorigenesis—by integrating gene expression and next-generation sequencing data. His research identifies transcription factors, pathways, and regulatory networks that mediate these effects, focusing especially on the anti-proliferative actions of interferons, a class of host defence molecules with potent antiviral, antitumour, and immunomodulatory properties. Using interferon-treated breast cancer cell lines and tumour-derived genomic data, he explores how these pathways and networks contribute to interferon-mediated anti-tumour responses. Understanding these regulatory interactions at a systems level may help reveal the genetic basis of key cellular phenotypes.
