High-dimensional phenotyping screens generate extensive cellular feature data after gene perturbations, such as knockouts or RNA interference. Analysing these effects systematically is key to understanding gene function.

Dr Markowetz introduces Nested Effects Models (NEMs), a probabilistic framework to infer genetic hierarchies from the nested structure of observed phenotypic effects. NEMs:
	1.	Identify clusters of genes with highly similar phenotypic profiles, and
	2.	Order genes or gene clusters based on subset relationships between phenotypes.

Unlike other graphical models based on conditional independence, NEMs rely on subset relations, offering both theoretical and practical advantages in reconstructing signaling pathways and regulatory networks.
