How does the brain work as an integrated system? Understanding the organization of brain graphs (networks), their community structure and time-varying topology is key to tackling this challenge. Network Neuroscience is an emerging field dedicated to understanding the structure and function of neural systems across scales, from neurons to circuits and ultimately to the whole brain. In this presentation I will review a few current themes and future directions. These include connectomics, structure/function relationships as disclosed in neuroimaging data, the growing use of computational models to map information flow and communication dynamics, and a novel edge-centric approach to track dynamic functional connectivity. I will try to identify some key issues along three main dimensions: networks, dynamics, and information.
