about: A number of neurological disorders such Alzheimer's and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), result from a complex network of interactions between multiple sub-cellular pathways. As many genes are differentially expressed at different ages, it is crucial to study the temporal evolution of such a network, or, in other words, how the cascade of events that leads from the healthy to the diseased state changes with time and with the age of the organism. The focus of our research is to build, analyze and model these networks of pathways.
