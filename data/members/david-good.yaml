about: |-
  I am currently involved in two lines of work: The first is concerned with the development of new communication and information technologies, and how research from the Arts Humanities and Social Sciences can be usefully brought to bear on the design of new technologies. To this end, I established the Crucible Network with Alan Blackwell in the Computer Laboratory.

  The second focuses on the development of the creative and innovative abilities of students, and how this prepares them for their future careers. This work builds on my time as Education Director of the Cambridge MIT Institute, and continues to involve collaboration with colleagues in the EHGI group.

  There are a number of projects in each line of work including a recently funded (EPSRC) activity working with various academic and commercial partners on the development of Media City UK.
