about: My name is Dr Joanne Kenney. I'm a neuroscientist with the Hub for Metabolic Psychiatry at the University of Edinburgh. My passion lies in the use of modern technologies such as MRI to study the brain and more recently, TB-PET scans to study across brain and body. I work with large-scale complex datasets and engage in computational neuroscience research.
