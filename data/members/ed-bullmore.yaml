about: |-
  Functional and structural neuroimaging, mostly MRI, of normal cognitive functions, effects of psychopharmacological agents on brain function, and neurospychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, autism, depression).

  Methodological focus on neurophysiological time series analysis, complex networks, wavelets and fractals.

  Cognitive and neuroimaging techniques as new tools for CNS drug discovery and development (I work half-time for GSK running the Clinical Unit Cambridge at Addenbrooke's Hospital).
